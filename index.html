				My name is <b>Brooke Forss</b> and I am a junior at <b>UW-Madison</b>. I am from a small town in northern Wisconsin 
				and am very excited to be pursuing a <b>History and English</b> major at a well-established university.
				I plan to use my degrees to explore a multitude of career options I am interested in such as: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i>Archives</i></li>
				<li><i>Museums</i></li>
				<li><i>Publishing</i></li>
				<li><i>Technical Writing</i></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				To help achieve these goals, I'm currently employed in the Archives at <a href = https://www.wisconsinhistory.org>
				The Wisconsin Historical Society!</a> Follow the link to see some of our awesome collections!
